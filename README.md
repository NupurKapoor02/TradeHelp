# TradeHelp

This python project aims to simplify stock trading for busy individuals by automating the tracking of news and trends for each stock. This project focuses on analyzing historical stock market data, conducting sentiment analysis, and predicting stock trends using machine learning models. We have implemented several trading strategies to aid in decision-making. The project consists of several key components. First, data collection involves gathering user input such as date range, and parameters, retrieving historical market data using yfinance and storing this data for further analysis. For predicting stock trends, the project utilizes an XGBoost classifier. Finally, seven different trading strategies are implemented to make informed buy or sell decisions.
